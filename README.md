## Sparkify PostGres ETL project
### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

### Objective
- Define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus.
- Write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

### Fact Table
- songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

### Dimension Tables
- users - users in the app
- songs - songs in music database
- artists - artists in music database
- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

### Something Extra
I've used copy command to bulk insert log data into the database instead of multiple insert queries.<br>
You can find the copy command below in ``etl.py`` under ``process_log_file`` function.
```
cur.copy_from(str_buffer, "songplays", sep="\t", columns=songplay_columns)
```
### Prerequesites
This project requires ``pandas`` and ``psycopg2`` packages installed.<br>
You can install them using pip command like ``pip3 install psycopg2``

### Instructions to run the project
- Run ``python3 ./create_tables.py`` command to drop already existing tables and create the tables.
- Then run ``python3 ./etl.py`` command to run the etl script to process the song and log data and import them into the database.
